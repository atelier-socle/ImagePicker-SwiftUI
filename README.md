# ImagePicker-SwiftUI

ImagePicker-SwiftUI is a sample to show how integrate MapKit using SwiftUI. It's currently featuring some basic image picker features such as choose a photo from the device photos, or taking a photo using the camera.

This repository is not usable as a framework, but you may find some code to reuse in your own project :)
